Whocanuse.com both an easy to use color contrast tool, and a way to bring attention and understanding to how color contrast affects different users.

The WCAG (Web Content Accessbility Guidelines) is an amazing accomplishment for the web, where organisations, companies and goverernments throughout the world came together to agree on how to make the web accessible, but unfortunately the guidelines and gradings aren't really that easy to understand for most people.

Rather than giving a grading to a collective of people, I thought I'd try and humanise them by showcasing just who is affeted by a failing grade.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repo.**

2.  **Install everything.**

    Navigate to wherever you cloned the whocanuse repo to and install all the things:

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Start developing.**

    Start it up!

    ```sh
    gatsby develop
    ```

3.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!
    
    *Note: You'll also see a second link: `http://localhost:8000/___graphql`. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql).*
